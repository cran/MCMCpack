// MCMCpack, Version 0.3-11
//

This package contains functions for posterior simulation for a number of
statistical models. All simulation is done in compiled C++ written in
the Scythe Statistical Library Version 0.3. All models return coda mcmc
objects that can then be summarized using coda functions or the coda
menu interface.  The package also contains some useful utility
functions, including some additional PDFs and pseudo-random number
generators for statistical distributions.

// Compilation
//

This package (along with Scythe) uses C++ and the Standard Template
Library (STL).  It requires use of the GCC compiler 3.0 or greater.  It
has been tested on GCC 3.1, and 3.2 on Linux and MacOS X.

We have also successfully compiled this package for Windows using
a MinGW cross-compiler using binutils 2.13, gcc 3.2, mingw
runtime 2.2, and w32api 2.0.  This is essentially the same setup
described by Yan and Rossini (2002), except for more recent
versions of the compiler to successfully handle the C++ issues
noted above. Many thanks to Dan Pemstein for helping with the
cross-compilation, and to Kurt Hornik and Fritz Leisch for their
help with debugging and service to the R community.

Please contact Andrew D. Martin <admartin@artsci.wustl.edu> if
you have any problems or questions.
