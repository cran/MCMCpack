// Compilation

This package (along with Scythe) uses C++ and the Standard Template
Library (STL).  We suggest using of the GCC compiler 4.0 or greater.  The
current package has been tested using GCC 4.0 on Linux and MacOS X. 

Many thanks to Dan Pemstein for helping with all sorts of C++ issues,
and to Kurt Hornik and Fritz Leisch for their help with debugging as
well as their service to the R community.  We are also very grateful to
Brian Ripley who provided C++ patches to fix a number of clang and Solaris
issues.
