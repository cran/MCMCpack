Description: This package contains functions for posterior
  simulation for a number of statistical models. All simulation
  is done in compiled C++ written in the Scythe Statistical
  Library Version 0.4. All models return coda mcmc objects that
  can then be summarized using coda functions or the coda menu
  interface.  The package also contains some useful utility
  functions, including some additional PDFs and pseudo-random
  number generators for statistical distributions.
