Depends: R (>= 2.0.0), coda (>= 0.8-1), MASS
Description: This package contains functions for posterior
  simulation for a number of statistical models. All simulation
  is done in compiled C++ written in the Scythe Statistical
  Library Version 1.0. All models return coda mcmc objects that
  can then be summarized using the coda package.  MCMCpack
  also contains some useful utility functions, including some
  additional density functions and pseudo-random number generators
  for statistical distributions, a general purpose Metropolis
  sampling algorithm, and tools for visualization.
